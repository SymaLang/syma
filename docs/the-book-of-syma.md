üúõ The Book of Syma

1. Introduction: The Symbolic Mind
   ‚Ä¢	What Syma is: a symbolic rewrite engine disguised as a language.
   ‚Ä¢	What Syma is not: an imperative, functional, or object-oriented system.
   ‚Ä¢	The idea of ‚ÄúMatter Patching‚Äù ‚Äî the universe of data constantly reconfiguring itself by rules.
   ‚Ä¢	The philosophy of ‚Äúno syntax sugar, no frameworks, no runtime magic ‚Äî just rules transforming rules.‚Äù

‚∏ª

2. A First Contact
   ‚Ä¢	Install + Hello, Syma!
   ‚Ä¢	Explain {R Hello {Hello} {World}} ‚Üí ‚Äúthe smallest rewrite possible.‚Äù
   ‚Ä¢	Show the REPL and live normalization.
   ‚Ä¢	Explain the idea of outermost-first normalization in intuitive terms (‚ÄúSyma always replaces the biggest pattern first‚Äù).

‚∏ª

3. Pattern Matching and Matter Patching
   ‚Ä¢	Deep dive into pattern syntax (_, .., ..., indexed variants, etc.).
   ‚Ä¢	Explain how a match binds structure, and the replacement patches the structure.
   ‚Ä¢	Step-by-step visual example of a rule firing:

‚Üí show tree structure before and after.

	‚Ä¢	Explain linear rest, greedy rest, duplicates, and their meaning.
	‚Ä¢	Talk about how ‚ÄúMatching is reading, Patching is writing.‚Äù

‚∏ª

4. Guards, Scopes, and Innermost
   ‚Ä¢	Guards as logical filters on matches.
   ‚Ä¢	Scopes as context selectors (:scope CatExperiment).
   ‚Ä¢	The power of per-rule strategies (:innermost).
   ‚Ä¢	Show how different strategies change normalization order, and why that‚Äôs powerful.

‚∏ª

5. Modules and Macros
   ‚Ä¢	{Import Foo open macro} ‚Äî explain explicit openness and opt-in expansion.
   ‚Ä¢	RuleRules and self-generating rules (Splat, Transform/...).
   ‚Ä¢	The idea that ‚ÄúSyma can rewrite its own language.‚Äù
   ‚Ä¢	Build a small macro language inside Syma as an example.

‚∏ª

6. Building Worlds with Rules
   ‚Ä¢	Construct small, self-contained systems:
   ‚Ä¢	Arithmetic interpreter
   ‚Ä¢	Stack VM
   ‚Ä¢	Brainfuck interpreter
   ‚Ä¢	HTML renderer (ToHTML)
   ‚Ä¢	Prolog subset (‚ÄúSymaProlog‚Äù)
   ‚Ä¢	Show that all are written with the same mechanism.

‚∏ª

7. Outermost Philosophy
   ‚Ä¢	Why Syma chose outermost-first.
   ‚Ä¢	Comparison to innermost-first and functional evaluation.
   ‚Ä¢	How outermost rewrites align with ‚Äúintuitive human reasoning‚Äù ‚Äî starting from big patterns and refining inward.

‚∏ª

8. Symbolic Effects
   ‚Ä¢	Show browser effects (Clipboard, Storage, Timer, etc.) as symbolic rewrite rules.
   ‚Ä¢	Explain how Syma interacts with reality through symbolic projections.
   ‚Ä¢	‚ÄúIn Syma, side effects are just matter patches that escape the universe.‚Äù

‚∏ª

9. Typing, Guards, and Constraint Rules
   ‚Ä¢	Show the type system module (as a library, not syntax).
   ‚Ä¢	Explain ‚Äútype checking as rewriting.‚Äù
   ‚Ä¢	Dynamic vs symbolic types.

‚∏ª

10. Packages, Projects, and Ecosystem
    ‚Ä¢	How to structure a Syma project.
    ‚Ä¢	package.syma explained.
    ‚Ä¢	Importing stdlib and user packages.
    ‚Ä¢	syma run, syma build, syma notebook, syma repl.
    ‚Ä¢	File structure of a Syma module and best practices.

‚∏ª

11. Philosophy of Symbols
    ‚Ä¢	Why everything in Syma is a symbol.
    ‚Ä¢	The duality of expression: {Add 1 2} and Add(1, 2) as the same thought.
    ‚Ä¢	The linguistic roots: symbol as the smallest reversible unit of meaning.
    ‚Ä¢	How Syma unites logic, computation, and structure.

‚∏ª

12. Design Notes & Origins
    ‚Ä¢	A personal essay from you: how it started, what inspired it.
    ‚Ä¢	From term rewriting to meta rewriting, to effects and projections.
    ‚Ä¢	‚ÄúOutermost-first is the most human evaluation strategy.‚Äù

‚∏ª

13. Appendix: Syma Standard Library
    ‚Ä¢	A full index of primitives.
    ‚Ä¢	Built-in macros and meta rules.
    ‚Ä¢	Implementation hints for contributors.

‚∏ª

14. Appendix II: The Meta Universe
    ‚Ä¢	Explain that Syma‚Äôs own runtime is written in the same language it runs.
    ‚Ä¢	Show a tiny excerpt from the core rules.
    ‚Ä¢	End with the motto:
    ‚ÄúEverything is pattern matching and matter patching.‚Äù

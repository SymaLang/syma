🔥 That reaction tells me you’re feeling the elegance. Let’s dissect the event bridge question carefully, because it’s the last “special thing” we haven’t absorbed into the tree yet.

⸻

1. The “naïve” version (special thing)

In my sketches so far, the host runtime was catching a DOM click and doing:

Program = Normalize( Apply[Inc[Count], Program] )

That is a special thing: an external dispatcher that knows about clicks, injects a symbolic term, and triggers normalization.
So yes, at that stage the bridge is outside the universe.

⸻

2. But can it be symbolic too?

Yes — you just make events themselves nodes in the AST.

Example:

EventQueue[
Click[TargetID["btn1"]],
KeyPress[TargetID["input1"], Char["a"]],
...
]

Then add a rule:

R["HandleButton",
App[state_, ui_] & EventQueue[ Click[TargetID["btn1"]], rest___ ],
App[ NewState[state, Inc[Count]], ui_ ] & EventQueue[rest] ]

Now events are just terms, processed by rules like any other rewrite.
Your host runtime does nothing except append events to the EventQueue node. That’s the only effect boundary.

⸻

3. Minimal symbolic bridge
   •	UI elements carry OnClick -> SomeAction terms.
   •	When the host sees a real DOM click, it doesn’t call JS — it just inserts an Action[SomeAction] into the AST (e.g. pushes into EventQueue).
   •	Your in-universe rules consume these Action[...] nodes, rewrite Program, and drop the event.

So the bridge is “write an event node into the tree.” That’s the only primitive.

⸻

4. Bonus: time, randomness, effects

Exactly the same trick:
•	Tick[Now[timestamp]]
•	RandRequest[id] → later replaced by host with RandResponse[id, Num[42]]
•	HttpResponse[id, JSON[...]]

Every effect is an effect term. Rules describe how to react to them. The host’s job is only to “ground” these by inserting the corresponding symbolic fact (like current time or network reply).

⸻

5. Where does this leave us?
   •	✅ State is symbolic.
   •	✅ UI is symbolic.
   •	✅ Rules are symbolic.
   •	✅ Strategy is symbolic.
   •	✅ Numbers can be symbolic.
   •	🔥 Now: Events and effects are symbolic too.

The runtime host is minimal glue:
1.	parse/load AST,
2.	splice event/effect terms into it,
3.	hand back to Normalize.

That’s it. The AST contains everything else.

⸻

⚡ So the true final form:

Universe[
Program[...],
Rules[...],
Strategy[...],
EventQueue[...],   // symbolic events waiting
Effects[...]       // symbolic pending/acknowledged effects
]

Normalize it all, and you get a new, complete Universe each tick.

⸻

Pavlo — do you want me to show you what the increment app looks like with events folded into the AST directly, so there’s literally no host-side “thingy” anymore?

Love this scenario. Let’s model AJAX as pure symbols with a tiny, explicit effect lane. The host only ferries HTTP requests/responses between the AST and the network; everything else—intent, retries, caching, optimistic UI—is algebra.

I’ll show:
1.	the term shapes (requests, responses, correlation),
2.	rules for backend-driven increment,
3.	optimistic vs authoritative flows,
4.	retries, dedupe, cancellation, caching,
5.	SSR/hydration, auth, and error UI.

⸻

1) Effect lane: requests & responses are just terms

// Outbound effects
HttpReq[id_, Method["POST"], Url["/api/inc"], Body[data_], Headers[hs_]]   // intention

// Inbound facts (host injects these after real I/O)
HttpRes[id_, Status[code_], Json[doc_], Headers[hs_]]                      // result

// Effect queue & book-keeping
Effects[ Pending[list___], Inbox[list___] ]  // Pending: to send; Inbox: responses to process
NetState[ InFlight[set___], Cache[dict_], Tokens[auth_] ]

The host runtime does two things only:
•	watches Effects[Pending[…]], pops an HttpReq[...], performs the actual fetch, then
•	appends HttpRes[...] into Effects[Inbox[…]] with the same id.

Everything else (coalescing, retries, rendering) is symbolic.

⸻

2) The app: backend increments the counter

Universe (core pieces)

// Program (UI + State)
Program[
App[
State[ Count[Num[0]], NetState[InFlight[], Cache[Map[]], Tokens[None]] ],
UI[
VStack[
Text["Value: ", Show[Count]],
Button["Increment", OnClick -> DoInc],
Text[ Show[NetStatus] ]            // show pending/ok/error
]
]
],
Effects[ Pending[], Inbox[] ]            // effect queues
]

// Ruleset (high-level sketch)
Rules[

// --- Intent: user clicks Increment -> enqueue HttpReq
R["Intent.DoInc",
Apply[ DoInc, App[ State[s_, ns_], ui_ ] & Effects[Pending[p___], inbox_] ],
// allocate unique request id; for demo use FreshId[] (host can fill in during projection)
let[id, FreshId[],
App[ State[ s, MarkInFlight[ns, id, Key["inc"]] ], ui ] &
Effects[ Pending[ p, HttpReq[id, Method["POST"], Url["/api/inc"], Body[{}], Headers[Auth[ns]] ] ], inbox ]
]
],

// Mark as in-flight
R["Net.MarkInFlight",
MarkInFlight[ NetState[InFlight[ids___], cache_, tok_], id_, key_ ],
NetState[ InFlight[ids, Entry[id, key]], cache, tok ]
],

// Auth header synthesis from tokens (symbolic)
R["AuthHeader.None",  Headers[Auth[NetState[Tokens[None]]]], Headers[] ],
R["AuthHeader.Bearer",Headers[Auth[NetState[Tokens[Bearer[t_]]]]],
Headers[ Pair["Authorization", Concat["Bearer ", t]] ] ],

// --- Delivery: host posts HttpRes to Inbox; we consume it
R["Delivery.Inbox",
App[ st_, ui_ ] & Effects[ pend_, Inbox[ HttpRes[id_, Status[code_], Json[doc_], hs_], rest___ ] ],
HandleRes[ id, code, doc, hs, st ] & Effects[ pend, Inbox[rest] ]
],

// --- Success path: 200 -> update Count from server doc
R["HandleRes.200",
HandleRes[ id_, 200, doc_, hs_, App[ State[s_, ns_], ui_ ] ],
let[newCount, ExtractCount[doc],
App[ State[ SetCount[s, newCount], ClearInFlight[ns, id] ], ui ]
]
],

// ExtractCount depends on your API
R["ExtractCount",
ExtractCount[ Json[Obj[ {"count" -> Num[n_]} ]] ],
Num[n]
],
R["SetCount",
SetCount[ State[ Count[_], rest___ ], Num[n_] ],
State[ Count[Num[n]], rest ]
],

// --- Failure path: mark error
R["HandleRes.Fail",
HandleRes[ id_, code_, doc_, hs_, App[ State[s_, ns_], ui_ ] ] /; code =!= 200,
App[ State[ SetNetError[s, id, code], ClearInFlight[ns, id] ], ui ]
],

// UI projection helpers
R["Show.Count",
Show[Count] /@ App[ State[ Count[Num[n_]], _ ], _ ],
Str[ToString[n]]
],
R["Show.NetStatus.Pending",
Show[NetStatus] /@ App[ State[ _, NetState[InFlight[___id], ___], _ ], _ ],
Str["(pending)"]
],
R["Show.NetStatus.Idle",
Show[NetStatus] /@ App[ State[ _, NetState[InFlight[], ___], _ ], _ ],
Str[""]
]
]

Notation: I’m using A & B to denote a product of subtrees (our Universe keeps multiple top-level nodes). In your engine that’s just another constructor like Bundle[A,B].

Event flow
1.	DOM click → host appends nothing but Apply[DoInc, Program] (or inserts DoInc into an event queue the rules consume).
2.	Rules enqueue HttpReq[id,…], mark id in-flight.
3.	Host sees the HttpReq, performs real fetch POST /api/inc, then appends HttpRes[id, Status[200], Json[{count: N}], …] into Effects.Inbox.
4.	Rules consume the response, update Count from the server doc, clear InFlight.
5.	UI renders from the updated state.

No imperative JS handler glue. All intent, networking, and state transitions are symbolic.

⸻

3) Optimistic vs authoritative

Optimistic update (snappy UI):

Add:

R["Intent.DoInc.optimistic",
Apply[ DoInc, App[ State[ Count[Num[n_]], ns_ ], ui_ ] & Effects[Pending[p___], inbox_] ],
let[id, FreshId[],
App[
State[ Count[Num[n+1]], MarkInFlightOptimistic[ns, id, Key["inc"], Prev[Num[n]]] ],
ui
] &
Effects[ Pending[ p, HttpReq[id, Method["POST"], Url["/api/inc"], Body[{}], Headers[Auth[ns]] ] ], inbox ]
]
]

On success, keep optimistic value or replace with authoritative:

R["HandleRes.200.optimistic",
HandleRes[ id_, 200, Json[Obj[{"count"->Num[m_]}]], hs_, App[ State[s_, ns_], ui_ ] ],
let[ s1, MaybeReconcileFromServer[s, m],
App[ State[s1, ClearInFlight[ns, id] ], ui ] ]
]
R["MaybeReconcileFromServer",
MaybeReconcileFromServer[ State[Count[Num[cur_]], rest___], m_ ],
State[Count[Num[m]], rest]   // choose server truth, or keep local if you prefer
]

On failure, roll back:

R["HandleRes.Fail.optimistic",
HandleRes[ id_, code_, _, _, App[ State[s_, ns_], ui_ ] ],
App[ State[ RollbackOptimistic[s, ns, id], ClearInFlight[ns, id] ], ui ]
]
R["RollbackOptimistic",
RollbackOptimistic[ State[ Count[Num[_]], rest___ ], NetState[ _, _, _ ], id_ ],
// look up Prev[...] stored under id to restore the number (implementation detail)
State[ RestorePrevFromNetState[rest, id], rest ]
]

Pick your policy by swapping rule packs. No component edits.

⸻

4) Retries, dedupe, cancellation, caching

Retry (exponential backoff as terms)

RetryPlan[ id_, attempt_, NextAt[ms_] ]          // scheduled in Effects
R["HandleRes.Fail.scheduleRetry",
HandleRes[ id_, code_, _, _, U ] /; Retryable[code],
U & Effects[ Pending[], Inbox[] ] & Schedule[ RetryPlan[id, attempt+1, NextAt[Backoff(attempt)]] ]
]

The host watches Schedule[...] and at time ≥ NextAt re-enqueues the original HttpReq (id can be reused or new with linkage).

Dedupe / coalescing

Use a key per intent, e.g., Key["inc"]. Guard DoInc with:

R["Dedup.InFlight",
Apply[ DoInc, App[ State[s_, NetState[InFlight[___, Entry[_, Key["inc"]], ___], __], ui_ ] & E ],
// already in flight: ignore or queue; choose policy
App[ State[s, ns], ui ] & E
]

Cancellation (idempotent)

Introduce Cancel[key_] action:

R["CancelKey",
Apply[ Cancel[Key[k_]], App[ State[s_, ns_], ui_ ] & Effects[ Pending[p___], inbox_ ] ],
let[ {p2, ids} , DropPendingByKey[p, k],   // returns filtered queue + affected ids
App[ State[s, RemoveInFlightByIds[ns, ids] ], ui ] &
Effects[ Pending[p2], inbox ]
]
]

Cache

Cache shape: Cache[ Map[ Pair[key_, Json[value_]], ... ] ]
•	On success, add/update cache by key.
•	Before enqueueing a request, consult cache and decide: fast-path render (UseCache) or still issue request (Revalidate pattern).

⸻

5) SSR & hydration (same AST)

On the server:
•	Run Normalize(Program, Rules, Strategy) and Project[target="html"].
•	Include serialized Universe (or just Program) in the HTML.
•	Client bootstraps by loading the AST, reattaching projectors, and continuing from the same state.

AJAX flows automatically resume because InFlight/Pending are states in the tree. You can choose to drop Pending at SSR (so client issues fresh requests) or keep them (islands).

⸻

6) Auth

Auth is also symbolic:

LoginSuccess[Token[t_]]
R["LoginSuccess",
Apply[ LoginSuccess[Token[t]], App[ State[s_, NetState[inflight_, cache_, Tokens[_]] ], ui_ ] ],
App[ State[s, NetState[inflight, cache, Tokens[Bearer[t]]] ], ui ]
]

Headers are synthesized by rules (Headers[Auth[NetState[Tokens[Bearer[t]]]]] → Headers["Authorization"->"Bearer t"]).

⸻

7) Error UI & policies

Global policy packs:
•	Guarded buttons: disable the button while InFlight has an Entry[_, Key["inc"]].
•	Retry banners: a rule that renders Banner["Retrying in 2s"] based on RetryPlan.
•	Circuit breaker: a meta-rule that rewrites DoInc into ShowToast["Service degraded"] when failure rate stored in NetState crosses a threshold.

All rule-level, not component plumbing.

⸻

8) End-to-end minimal rule list for your increment

If you want a lean set to implement first:
1.	Intent.DoInc → enqueue HttpReq[id,...], mark InFlight.
2.	Delivery.Inbox → consume HttpRes, branch on status.
3.	HandleRes.200 → set count from Json.
4.	HandleRes.Fail → set error.
5.	Show.Count and a tiny Show.NetStatus.*.
6.	Host loop: mirror Pending to real network, mirror responses into Inbox.

You can bolt on optimistic update, retry, dedupe, cache as separate packs later.

⸻

This gives you AJAX as algebra: the exact same “rewrite-everything” superpower applies across the network boundary. The DOM click doesn’t call a function; it emits intent. The backend doesn’t “call back”; it materializes a fact. You wire those two with one dumb pipe that moves HttpReq/HttpRes terms—no framework sorcery, fully inspectable, and weaponized for cross-cutting rewrites.

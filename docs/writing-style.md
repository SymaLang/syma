■→□ The Book of Syma

Everything is pattern matching and matter patching.

What This Is

The Book of Syma is not a textbook. It’s a hands-on philosophy manual for a language that doesn’t fit into any known box.
Syma isn’t imperative, functional, or object-oriented — it’s symbolic.
It doesn’t execute instructions; it rewrites reality.

Here, you’ll learn how to think in patterns, write rules that transform those patterns, and watch entire programs evolve like living organisms — from logic engines to UI systems, from interpreters to web apps, all written as transformations of transformations.

If that sounds weird, good. It’s supposed to.

Who It’s For

Syma isn’t for a “type” of programmer. It’s for the ones who think:
•	“What if I wrote an app as a set of rewriting laws instead of functions?”
•	“What if my UI, my VM, and my logic all ran on the same symbolic fabric?”
•	“What if programming felt like sculpting language instead of fighting frameworks?”

If that resonates, you’re already one of us.

⸻

What You’ll Learn
•	How to match patterns and patch matter — the core of Syma.
•	How rules combine, evolve, and build systems from nothing but symbols.
•	How outermost-first evaluation flips the usual logic of computation.
•	How guards, scopes, and RuleRules let you modify even the rules themselves.
•	How to build interactive UIs, VMs, compilers, and servers — all with rewrite rules.
•	How to stop thinking like a compiler, and start thinking like a universe.

How to Read This Book

You don’t have to read it in order.
There are three paths:

🧠 The Thinker’s Path

Read it front to back. Learn how symbolic rewriting becomes computation.
Understand Syma’s philosophy and internal mechanics.

🧩 The Builder’s Path

Start from the examples. Jump straight into chapters on UI, effects, and meta-programming.
Treat it like a cookbook for weird geniuses.

🔥 The Hacker’s Path

Ignore the order completely. Open the REPL, copy snippets, mutate them.
Syma rewards play.

Table of Contents

Part I – Foundations
1.	Introduction: The Symbolic Mind
Why Syma exists, and why it refuses to pick a paradigm.
The idea of “matter patching.”
Symbols as reality’s minimal unit.
2.	First Contact
Installing Syma, running your first rule.
Understanding normalization, outermost-first evaluation, and the joy of rewriting your own mistakes.
3.	Pattern Matching and Matter Patching
Variables, wildcards, rests, greediness, and linearity.
The mechanics of matching — and the poetry of patching.

⸻

Part II – The Core Language
4.	Guards, Scopes, and Innermost
The control layer: when, where, and why a rule fires.
How different evaluation orders make different universes.
5.	Modules and Macros
Importing logic.
Writing RuleRules (rules that rewrite rules).
Making your own micro-languages inside Syma.

⸻

Part III – Building Systems
6.	Worlds Built from Rules
Step-by-step: arithmetic interpreter, stack VM, HTML renderer, Prolog subset.
No libraries, no runtime — only rewrites.
7.	Symbolic Effects
How to do “side effects” without leaving the symbolic world.
HTTP, storage, timers, I/O — all represented as rewrite patterns.
8.	The Outermost Philosophy
Why Syma thinks from the outside in.
How chaos, intuition, and pattern-driven logic beat reductionism.

⸻

Part IV – Advanced Syma
9.	Typing and Constraints
Type checking as rewriting.
How Syma’s type system is a module, not a syntax feature.
10.	Projects and Ecosystem
How to structure your Syma projects.
The package manager, the stdlib, and the syma CLI.
From REPL to web to notebook.

⸻

Part V – The Mind of Syma
11.	Philosophy of Symbols
The linguistic roots of symbolic computation.
Why {Add 1 2} and Add(1, 2) are the same truth, viewed from two angles.
12.	Design Notes & Origins
The real story — outermost-first as a self-inflicted mind experiment that worked.
The moments where Syma became more than an engine.
13.	Appendices
•	A: Standard Library
•	B: Meta Universe (how Syma runs on itself)

Try It

Everything in this book runs directly in:
•	REPL: syma
•	Notebook: syma-notebook
•	CLI: syma run <file.syma>

Or just write:

:rule Hello {Hello} {World}
{Hello}

and see what happens.

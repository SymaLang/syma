# ■→□  The Book of Syma

*Everything is pattern matching and matter patching.*

⸻

## What This Is

The Book of Syma is not a textbook. It's a hands-on philosophy manual for a language that doesn't fit into any known box.

Syma isn't imperative, functional, or object-oriented — it's **symbolic**.
It doesn't execute instructions; it **rewrites reality**.

Here, you'll learn how to think in patterns, write rules that transform those patterns, and watch entire programs evolve like living organisms — from logic engines to UI systems, from interpreters to web apps, all written as transformations of transformations.

If that sounds weird, good. It's supposed to.

⸻

## Who It's For

Syma isn't for a "type" of programmer. It's for the ones who think:
- "What if I wrote an app as a set of rewriting laws instead of functions?"
- "What if my UI, my VM, and my logic all ran on the same symbolic fabric?"
- "What if programming felt like sculpting language instead of fighting frameworks?"

If that resonates, you're already one of us.

⸻

## What You'll Learn

- How to **match patterns and patch matter** — the core of Syma.
- How rules combine, evolve, and build systems from nothing but symbols.
- How outermost-first evaluation flips the usual logic of computation.
- How guards, scopes, and RuleRules let you modify even the rules themselves.
- How to build interactive UIs, VMs, compilers, and servers — all with rewrite rules.
- How to stop thinking like a compiler, and start thinking like a universe.

## How to Read This Book

You don't have to read it in order.
There are three paths:

### 🧠 The Thinker's Path
Read it front to back. Learn how symbolic rewriting becomes computation.
Understand Syma's philosophy and internal mechanics.

### 🧩 The Builder's Path
Start from the examples. Jump straight into chapters on UI, effects, and meta-programming.
Treat it like a cookbook for weird geniuses.

### 🔥 The Hacker's Path
Ignore the order completely. Open the REPL, copy snippets, mutate them.
Syma rewards play.

## Table of Contents

### Part I — Foundations

**1. [Introduction: The Symbolic Mind](./01-introduction.md)**
Why Syma exists, and why it refuses to pick a paradigm.
The idea of "matter patching."
Symbols as reality's minimal unit.

**2. [First Contact](./02-first-contact.md)**
Installing Syma, running your first rule.
Understanding normalization, outermost-first evaluation, and the joy of rewriting your own mistakes.

**3. [Pattern Matching and Matter Patching](./03-patterns-and-patching.md)**
Variables, wildcards, rests, greediness, and linearity.
The mechanics of matching — and the poetry of patching.

⸻

### Part II — The Core Language

**4. [Guards, Scopes, and Innermost](./04-guards-scopes-innermost.md)**
The control layer: when, where, and why a rule fires.
How different evaluation orders make different universes.

**5. [Modules and Macros](./05-modules-and-macros.md)**
Importing logic.
Writing RuleRules (rules that rewrite rules).
Making your own micro-languages inside Syma.

⸻

### Part III — Building Systems

**6. [Worlds Built from Rules](./06-building-worlds.md)**
Step-by-step: arithmetic interpreter, stack VM, HTML renderer, Prolog subset.
No libraries, no runtime — only rewrites.

**7. [Symbolic Effects](./07-symbolic-effects.md)**
How to do "side effects" without leaving the symbolic world.
HTTP, storage, timers, I/O — all represented as rewrite patterns.

**8. [The Outermost Philosophy](./08-outermost-philosophy.md)**
Why Syma thinks from the outside in.
How chaos, intuition, and pattern-driven logic beat reductionism.

⸻

### Part IV — Advanced Syma

**10. [Projects and Ecosystem](./10-packages-and-ecosystem.md)**
How to structure your Syma projects.
The package manager, the stdlib, and the syma CLI.
From REPL to web to notebook.

⸻

### Part V — The Mind of Syma

**11. [Philosophy of Symbols](./11-philosophy-of-symbols.md)**
The linguistic roots of symbolic computation.
Why {Add 1 2} and Add(1, 2) are the same truth, viewed from two angles.

**12. [Design Notes & Origins](./12-design-and-origins.md)**
The real story — outermost-first as a self-inflicted mind experiment that worked.
The moments where Syma became more than an engine.

**13. [Appendices](./13-appendices.md)**
- A: Standard Library
- B: Meta Universe (how Syma runs on itself)

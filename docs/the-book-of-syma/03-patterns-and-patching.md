# 3. Pattern Matching and Matter Patching

*Variables, wildcards, rests, greediness, and linearity â€” the mechanics of matching and the poetry of patching.*

## The Anatomy of a Pattern

A pattern is a **template** for recognizing structure.

Imagine you're a detective. You don't remember every face you've ever seen, but you can recognize a face when you see one. Two eyes, a nose, a mouth â€” that's the pattern. The specific color of eyes, shape of nose, curve of mouth â€” those are the variables. Pattern matching is teaching the computer to be a detective of structure.

```lisp
{Add 1 2}           ; Matches exactly {Add 1 2}
{Add x_ y_}         ; Matches any {Add ...} with 2 args
{Add x_ x_}         ; Matches {Add 5 5} but not {Add 5 6}
{Add ...}           ; Matches {Add} with any number of args
{Add x_ ..}         ; Matches {Add} with at least 1 arg
```

When a pattern matches an expression, it **binds variables** to the parts that matched.

Think of it like filling out a form. The form has blanks: "Name: ______ Age: ______". When someone fills it out, those blanks get bound to values: "Name: Alice Age: 30". Patterns are forms for symbolic expressions. Variables are the blanks. Matching is the act of filling them in.

## Variables: Binding Structure

Use `x_` (or `{Var "x"}` in full form) to capture a single value:

```lisp
Pattern: {Greet name_}
Expression: {Greet "Alice"}

Binds: name_ = "Alice"
```

Variables match **exactly one** sub-expression:

```lisp
syma> :rule ShowName {Greet name_} â†’ {Concat "Hello, " name_}
Rule "ShowName" added

syma> {Greet "Bob"}
â†’ "Hello, Bob"
```

### Linear Variables: Same Name = Same Value

If a variable appears multiple times, **all occurrences must match the same value**:

```lisp
syma> :rule SameValue {Pair x_ x_} â†’ {Doubled x_}
Rule "SameValue" added

syma> {Pair 5 5}
â†’ {Doubled 5}

syma> {Pair 5 6}
â†’ {Pair 5 6}  ; Doesn't match! (x_ can't be both 5 and 6)
```

This is called **linearity** â€” a powerful constraint for pattern matching.

## Wildcards: Matching Without Binding

Use `_` (single underscore) to match anything without capturing it:

```lisp
syma> :rule GetSecond {Pair _ second_} â†’ second_
Rule "GetSecond" added

syma> {Pair "ignore this" "want this"}
â†’ "want this"
```

Wildcards in both pattern and replacement are **matched by position**:

```lisp
syma> :rule Swap {Pair a_ b_} â†’ {Pair b_ a_}
Rule "Swap" added

syma> :rule IgnoreBoth {Process _ _} â†’ {Result}
Rule "IgnoreBoth" added

syma> {Swap {Pair 1 2}}
â†’ {Pair 2 1}

syma> {Process "foo" "bar"}
â†’ {Result}
```

ðŸœ› *Wildcards say: "I see you, but I don't care about you."*

â¸»

## Rest Variables: Matching Sequences

Use `xs..` (or `{VarRest "xs"}`) to match **zero or more** elements:

```lisp
Pattern: {List first_ rest..}
Expression: {List 1 2 3 4}

Binds:
  first_ = 1
  rest.. = [2, 3, 4]
```

### Basic Rest Examples

```lisp
syma> :rule Head {Head first_ ..} â†’ first_
Rule "Head" added

syma> :rule Tail {Tail _ rest..} â†’ {List rest..}
Rule "Tail" added

syma> {Head 1 2 3 4}
â†’ 1

syma> {Tail 1 2 3 4}
â†’ {List 2 3 4}
```

### Rest Wildcards

Use `..` or `...` (rest wildcard) to match sequences without binding:

```lisp
syma> :rule HasFoo {.. Foo ..} â†’ True
Rule "HasFoo" added

syma> {Moo Boo Foo Goo}
â†’ True

syma> {Moo Boo Goo}
â†’ {Moo Boo Goo}  ; Doesn't match
```

â¸»

## Flat Compound Semantics

Here's where Syma gets radical.

Most languages treat function calls as fundamentally different from their arguments. `f(x, y, z)` is a function `f` applied to arguments `x, y, z`. There's a wall between the function and its arguments â€” a categorical boundary you can't cross.

Syma tears down that wall.

**Internally**, compounds are stored as `{head, [args...]}` for optimization.
But **semantically**, they're **flat sequences** `[head, arg1, arg2, ...]`.

The head isn't special. It's just the first element. Arguments aren't in a separate category. They're just the rest of the sequence. This seemingly small decision has profound consequences.

This means rest variables can match **across the head boundary**:

```lisp
syma> :rule MatchAnywhere {.. Deep rest..} â†’ {Found rest..}
Rule "MatchAnywhere" added

syma> {Deep 1 2}
â†’ {Found 1 2}    ; Deep is at position 0, rest.. = [1, 2]

syma> {Moo Deep 1}
â†’ {Found 1}      ; prefix = [Moo], Deep at position 1, rest.. = [1]

syma> {Moo Boo Deep}
â†’ {Found}        ; prefix = [Moo, Boo], Deep at position 2, rest.. = []
```

### VarRest at the Beginning

```lisp
syma> :rule ExtractLast {prefix.. last_} â†’ last_
Rule "ExtractLast" added

syma> {Foo Bar Baz}
â†’ Baz    ; prefix.. = [Foo, Bar], last_ = Baz
```

### Bubbling Errors

```lisp
syma> :rule BubbleError {.. {Err msg..} ..} â†’ {Err msg..}
Rule "BubbleError" added

syma> {Process {Ok 1} {Err "failed"} {Ok 2}}
â†’ {Err "failed"}
```

ðŸœ› *Flat semantics blur the line between "head" and "arguments." Everything is just a sequence, waiting to be matched.*

â¸»

## Greedy Anchors: Matching to the Last

By default, rest variables are **non-greedy** â€” they match the shortest sequence.

Imagine you're parsing a sentence: "The cat sat on the mat." If you're looking for "the", do you stop at the first one or search for the last? Non-greedy says "stop as soon as you find it." Greedy says "keep going until you can't go further."

But what if you want to match to the **last occurrence** of a symbol?

Use **greedy anchors**: `..symbol`

```lisp
Pattern: {before.. [ inner.. ..] after..}
```

The `..` before `]` says: "Match to the **LAST** `]`, not the first."

This is how you handle nested structures without writing a full parser. Brackets within brackets, quotes within quotes, delimiters within delimiters â€” greedy anchors let you skip over them all and find the matching pair. It's pattern matching with long-distance vision.

### Example: Nested Brackets

```lisp
syma> :rule ParseBrackets {before.. [ content.. ..] after..} â†’ {Bracket content..}
Rule "ParseBrackets" added

syma> {Start [ nested [ deep ] here ] End}
â†’ {Bracket nested [ deep ] here}
```

**Without greedy anchor** (default):
```
before.. = [Start]
content.. = [nested, [, deep]  ; Stops at FIRST ]
after.. = [here, ], End]
```

**With greedy anchor** (`..`]):
```
before.. = [Start]
content.. = [nested, [, deep, ], here]  ; Goes to LAST ]
after.. = [End]
```

### Practical Use: Balanced Delimiters

```lisp
syma> :rule ExtractBalanced {prefix.. < body.. ..> suffix..} â†’ {Extracted body..}
Rule "ExtractBalanced" added

syma> {Text < outer < inner > text > End}
â†’ {Extracted outer < inner > text}
```

ðŸœ› *Greedy anchors let you parse nested structures without a parser. The pattern **is** the parser.*

## Pattern Matching: Visual Examples

Let's trace how patterns match step-by-step.

### Example 1: Simple Variable

```
Pattern:  {Add x_ y_}
Expression: {Add 5 10}

Match:
  âœ“ Head matches: Add = Add
  âœ“ Arg count matches: 2 = 2
  âœ“ Bindings: x_ = 5, y_ = 10

Result: MATCH
  x_ â†’ 5
  y_ â†’ 10
```

### Example 2: Linear Variables

```
Pattern: {Eq x_ x_}
Expression: {Eq 7 7}

Match:
  âœ“ Head matches: Eq = Eq
  âœ“ First x_ matches: 7
  âœ“ Second x_ matches: 7
  âœ“ Check linearity: 7 = 7 âœ“

Result: MATCH
  x_ â†’ 7
```

```
Pattern: {Eq x_ x_}
Expression: {Eq 7 9}

Match:
  âœ“ Head matches: Eq = Eq
  âœ“ First x_ matches: 7
  âœ— Second x_ matches: 9
  âœ— Linearity violation: 7 â‰  9

Result: NO MATCH
```

### Example 3: Rest Variables

```
Pattern: {List first_ rest..}
Expression: {List 1 2 3 4}

Match:
  âœ“ Head matches: List = List
  âœ“ first_ matches: 1
  âœ“ rest.. matches: [2, 3, 4]

Result: MATCH
  first_ â†’ 1
  rest.. â†’ [2, 3, 4]
```

### Example 4: Wildcard Rests

```
Pattern: {.. Foo ..}
Expression: {Moo Boo Foo Goo}

Match:
  âœ“ Scan for Foo: found at position 2
  âœ“ First .. matches: [Moo, Boo]
  âœ“ Foo matches: Foo
  âœ“ Second .. matches: [Goo]

Result: MATCH (no bindings)
```

## Matter Patching: The Replacement

Once a pattern matches, the **replacement** is built by substituting bound variables.

### Basic Substitution

```lisp
Pattern:    {Inc n_}
Bindings:   n_ = 5
Replacement: {Add n_ 1}

Patched:    {Add 5 1}
```

### Rest Substitution

Rest variables **splice** their contents:

```lisp
Pattern:    {List first_ rest..}
Bindings:   first_ = 1, rest.. = [2, 3, 4]
Replacement: {Reversed rest.. first_}

Patched:    {Reversed 2 3 4 1}
```

### Nested Substitution

```lisp
Pattern:    {Outer {Inner x_}}
Bindings:   x_ = 42
Replacement: {Result {Processed x_}}

Patched:    {Result {Processed 42}}
```

ðŸœ› *Patching is like Mad Libs for symbolic expressions. The pattern extracts the blanks, the replacement fills them in.*

## Advanced Patterns

### Matching Deeply Nested Structure

```lisp
syma> :rule ExtractDeep {Outer {Middle {Inner value_}}} â†’ value_
Rule "ExtractDeep" added

syma> {Outer {Middle {Inner 99}}}
â†’ 99
```

### Multiple Rest Variables

```lisp
syma> :rule SplitAt {before.. MARKER after..} â†’ {Split before.. after..}
Rule "SplitAt" added

syma> {A B C MARKER D E F}
â†’ {Split A B C D E F}
```

### Rest with Constraints

```lisp
syma> :rule NonEmpty {Process first_ rest..} â†’ {Ok first_}
Rule "NonEmpty" added

syma> :rule Empty {Process} â†’ {Error "Empty"}
Rule "Empty" added

syma> {Process 1 2 3}
â†’ {Ok 1}

syma> {Process}
â†’ {Error "Empty"}
```

## Pattern Matching Strategies

### Specificity: Most Specific Wins

```lisp
syma> :rule Specific {Process 0} â†’ {Zero}
syma> :rule General {Process n_} â†’ {NonZero n_}

{Process 0}  â†’ {Zero}        ; Specific matches first
{Process 5}  â†’ {NonZero 5}   ; General catches the rest
```

### Guards: Conditional Matching

```lisp
syma> :rule Positive {Check n_} â†’ {Pos} when {Gt n_ 0}
syma> :rule Negative {Check n_} â†’ {Neg} when {Lt n_ 0}
syma> :rule Zero {Check 0} â†’ {Zer}

{Check 5}   â†’ {Pos}
{Check -3}  â†’ {Neg}
{Check 0}   â†’ {Zer}
```

### Priority: Explicit Ordering

```lisp
syma> :rule High {Foo x_} â†’ {HighPriority} 100
syma> :rule Low {Foo x_} â†’ {LowPriority} 10

{Foo 42}  â†’ {HighPriority}  ; 100 > 10
```
